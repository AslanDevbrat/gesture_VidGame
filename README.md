## Introduction
This project is an amazing blend of Computer vision and Video Game.
In simple words I can say move you finger in front of camera
and just drive the car as show in the following gif

### I know you want play too !!!

## Prerequisite
Python libraries that are required by the project are given in the 
`requirement.txt`
Apart from it if you have Pycharm that would be great but not mandatory.


## Installation
1. Clone this repository
    `git clone https://github.com/AslanDevbrat/gesture_VidGame.git`
   
2. Open the file either in PyCharm or other IDE
3. Now open a terminal in the current directory and run `python main.py`

**Remember Don't close the game Window only minimize it**
   
4. Now open Another terminal in the same directory and run `python camera.py`
    ![](camera_py.gif)
   
**Remember Don't close this window only minimize it if you want to close it press 'q'**
   
5. This is the last step, but the most important step. If you have followed me till now you have
got two different window one which shows camera feed, and the one which show the game. Now place 
   these two window side by side and **click on the game window**. If you don't click on game 
   window your camera feed will freeze.
   **Note** In the following gif, when my cursor is on the hand tracking window the camera feed freezes.
   So to avoid it move your cursor and **click on the game window**
